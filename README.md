# threejs-project

Interactive project showcasing the capabilities of Three.js in 3D modeling.

See a live version [here](https://threejs-project.tech/)

## Installation

First, cd into /server to install dependencies,

```bash
cd server
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

and start the backend with:

```bash
npm start
```

then cd into client to install dependencies:

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

and start the development server with

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Getting Started

The `dalle.routes.js` route will need an API (OPENAI_API_KEY) key from openai for image generation.

I recommend hosting the backend on [https://render.com/](https://render.com/)

Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) with your browser to see the result.
